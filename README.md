Cucumber is a popular tool used in software test automation projects. ðŸ“Œ

The tags section in the @CucumberOptions annotation is a powerful feature for organizing scenarios and scenario groups and running them under specific conditions.

These tables serve as a guide to understand how Cucumber tags are used and which combinations execute specific tests.

The tag features of Cucumber can assist in organizing and managing scenarios more effectively in your test automation projects.
